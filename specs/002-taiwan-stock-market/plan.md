# Implementation Plan: Taiwan Stock Market Transaction Data Tool

**Branch**: `002-taiwan-stock-market` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/shiumingli/workspace/stock/specs/002-taiwan-stock-market/spec.md`

## Summary
This feature will provide a tool to check daily transaction data for specified stocks in the Taiwan stock market. It will also provide weekly and monthly summaries.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., requests, pandas, beautifulsoup4]
**Storage**: Local markdown files
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Local machine
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., response time < 1s]
**Constraints**: Use existing libraries as much as possible.
**Scale/Scope**: Small scale, for personal use.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (cli)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed: stock_data_fetcher (fetches and processes stock data)
- CLI per library: `stock-data --stocks <stock_codes> --today|--weekly|--monthly`
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? No

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1.  **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
    *   Research best Python libraries for web scraping and data manipulation (e.g., requests, pandas, beautifulsoup4).
2.  **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: research.md

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1.  **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`.
2.  **Generate API contracts** → `contracts/`.
3.  **Generate contract tests**.
4.  **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs.

**Estimated Output**: tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
